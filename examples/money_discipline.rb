# Money Discipline: every money bug in production is the same three
# bugs - floats for currency, arithmetic before validation, and
# rounding decided at the last minute by whoever's line of code got
# there first. This runs an invoicing plan twice: once the way demos
# do it (floats), once the way ledgers demand (integer cents, a Money
# value object, rounding policy declared at the boundary) - and lets
# a penny audit judge them both.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/money_discipline.rb

# Runs offline; the discrepancy is real IEEE 754, not contrivance.

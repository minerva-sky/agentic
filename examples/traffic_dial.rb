# The Traffic Dial: a canary rollout as one knob. New code starts at
# one lane of traffic; every healthy stage turns the dial up, and the
# moment the latency budget burns, the dial turns itself back down.
# No feature flags service, no rollout platform - a RateLimit, resized.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/traffic_dial.rb
#
# Runs offline; v2 hides a regression that only appears above 3 lanes.

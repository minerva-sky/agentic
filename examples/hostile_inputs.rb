# Hostile Inputs: a parser's real spec is what it does with input
# nobody intended. The journal's replay parses a file that - by the
# journal's own reason for existing - may end mid-write. In round 12
# this probe caught the torn tail denying ALL recovery; the round-13
# release made replay tolerant-by-default (salvage whole lines,
# REPORT damage) with a strict mode for auditors. This probe is now
# the acceptance test that keeps it that way.
